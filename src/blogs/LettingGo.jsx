        <p>Letting go isn’t poetic when you’re in the middle of it. It’s not graceful. It’s not peaceful.It feels like you're losing a part of yourself — the part that once made you feel alive, seen, loved, or safe.</p>
        <p>
          And yet, life keeps whispering: “Release. You don’t need to carry this anymore.”
          But how do you let go of something that once meant everything to you? 
          How do you walk away when your heart still lingers? 
          How do you forgive when the wounds are still tender?

        We often think letting go means pretending it didn’t matter.But real letting go is sacred.
        It means:

  <h2>My Story: The Lesson Life Whispered Through Loss</h2>
  <p>
    Letting go sounds like something strong people do. But what I’ve learned is—
    sometimes it’s not about strength. It’s about survival. There was a season in my life
    where everything hit at once. Debt was mounting. My family was far. The business I poured
    my soul into didn’t go where I dreamed it would. I was waking up with a pressure in my chest,
    trying to smile through the weight of questions I didn’t have answers to.
    And in the middle of all that, I lost the one person who felt like home.
    The breakup wasn’t explosive. It wasn’t cruel. It was just… full of weight. Timing. Life.
    Fear. Confusion. She had her walls, and I had my wounds. But even now, I don’t think either of us
    stopped feeling. What I felt for her wasn’t some casual love story. It was deep, layered, and honest.
    She made my world feel softer when everything else was hard. And when it ended, it wasn’t just a relationship
    I lost—it felt like I lost my safe place.
  </p>

  <div className={styles.sideBySide}>
    <blockquote>
      What made it harder was that I couldn’t talk about it. <br />
      Not really. <br />
      I didn’t want to seem broken. <br />
      I didn’t want to be that guy, still holding on to something that’s already gone.
    </blockquote>
    <img className={styles.book} src={blogImages.breakup} alt="breakup" />
  </div>

  <p>
    But here’s the truth—I was holding on.
    Not because I didn’t want to move on…
    But because I didn’t know how to let go of something that still felt so real in my bones.
    I’d walk through the day with purpose, but every now and then, a memory would blindside me—a laugh,
    a dream, a future we once spoke about as if it were certain.
    The shame didn’t just come from losing her. It came from losing myself in the process.
    I kept reaching out—to people, to distractions—hoping someone would save me from the heaviness.
    But no one could. Because I hadn’t looked inside. I was afraid of what I’d find.
    Eventually, I stopped running. I sat with the mess. I looked at every shattered piece of who
    I thought I had to be… and I forgave him.
    I started letting go of needing to be perfect, of needing to have all the answers.
    And slowly—painfully, patiently—I started learning how to be there for myself.
    That’s when I realized…
    Letting go doesn’t mean forgetting.
    It means making space.
    Space to grow, space to breathe, space to love again—even if that love, for now, is just for yourself.
    I haven’t “moved on” completely. There are still quiet moments where I think of her.
    Not in desperation, not in regret… Just in remembrance—of what was good, what was real,
    and what will always be part of my story.
    And maybe, just maybe…
    That kind of love doesn’t need a neat ending.
    It just needs to be honored—as the chapter that shaped me the most.
