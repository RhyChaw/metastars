        <p>Letting go isn‚Äôt poetic when you‚Äôre in the middle of it. It‚Äôs not graceful. It‚Äôs not peaceful.It feels like you're losing a part of yourself  - the part that once made you feel alive, seen, loved, or safe.</p>
        <p>
          And yet, life keeps whispering: ‚ÄúRelease. You don‚Äôt need to carry this anymore.‚Äù
          But how do you let go of something that once meant everything to you? 
          How do you walk away when your heart still lingers? 
          How do you forgive when the wounds are still tender?

        </h2>
        <p>
        We often think letting go means pretending it didn‚Äôt matter.But real letting go is sacred.
        It means:

        <div className={styles.sideBySide}>
          <ul>
            <li>I'm choosing peace over resentment.</li>

        </div>

        <p>Sometimes we hold on because we think we still need what once comforted us.But the truth is: what comforted you in the past might be the very thing confining you now.</p>

  <h2>My Story: The Lesson Life Whispered Through Loss</h2>
  <p>
    Letting go sounds like something strong people do. <br />
    But what I‚Äôve learned is - sometimes it‚Äôs not about strength. <br />
    It‚Äôs about survival. <br /><br />

    There was a season in my life where everything hit at once. <br />
    Debt was mounting. My family was far. <br />
    The business I poured my soul into didn‚Äôt go where I dreamed it would. <br />
    I was waking up with a pressure in my chest, trying to smile through the weight of questions I didn‚Äôt have answers to. <br /><br />

    And in the middle of all that, I lost the one person who felt like home. <br />
    The breakup wasn‚Äôt explosive. It wasn‚Äôt cruel. <br />
    It was just‚Ä¶ full of weight. Timing. Life. Fear. Confusion. <br />
    She had her walls, and I had my wounds. <br /><br />

    But even now, I don‚Äôt think either of us stopped feeling. <br />
    What I felt for her wasn‚Äôt some casual love story. <br />
    It was deep, layered, and honest. <br />
    She made my world feel softer when everything else was hard. <br />
    And when it ended, it wasn‚Äôt just a relationship I lost - it felt like I lost my safe place.
  </p>

  <div className={styles.sideBySide}>
    <blockquote>
      What made it harder was that I couldn‚Äôt talk about it. <br />
      Not really. <br />
      I didn‚Äôt want to seem broken. <br />
      I didn‚Äôt want to be that guy, still holding on to something that‚Äôs already gone.
    </blockquote>
    <img className={styles.book} src={blogImages.breakup} alt="breakup" />
  </div>

  <p>
    But here‚Äôs the truth - I was holding on. <br />
    Not because I didn‚Äôt want to move on‚Ä¶ <br />
    But because I didn‚Äôt know how to let go of something that still felt so real in my bones. <br /><br />

    I‚Äôd walk through the day with purpose, but every now and then, a memory would blindside me - a laugh, a dream, a future we once spoke about as if it were certain. <br />
    The shame didn‚Äôt just come from losing her. <br />
    It came from losing myself in the process. <br /><br />

    I kept reaching out - to people, to distractions - hoping someone would save me from the heaviness. <br />
    But no one could. <br />
    Because I hadn‚Äôt looked inside. <br />
    I was afraid of what I‚Äôd find. <br /><br />

    Eventually, I stopped running. <br />
    I sat with the mess. <br />
    I looked at every shattered piece of who I thought I had to be‚Ä¶ and I forgave him. <br /><br />

    I started letting go of needing to be perfect, of needing to have all the answers. <br />
    And slowly - painfully, patiently - I started learning how to be there for myself. <br /><br />

    That‚Äôs when I realized‚Ä¶ <br />
    Letting go doesn‚Äôt mean forgetting. <br />
    It means making space. <br />
    Space to grow, space to breathe, space to love again - even if that love, for now, is just for yourself. <br /><br />

    I haven‚Äôt ‚Äúmoved on‚Äù completely. <br />
    There are still quiet moments where I think of her. <br />
    Not in desperation, not in regret‚Ä¶ <br />
    Just in remembrance - of what was good, what was real, and what will always be part of my story. <br /><br />

    And maybe, just maybe‚Ä¶ <br />
    That kind of love doesn‚Äôt need a neat ending. <br />
    It just needs to be honored - as the chapter that shaped me the most.
